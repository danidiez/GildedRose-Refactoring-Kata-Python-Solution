# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-Python-Solution
Fixing code for the GildedRose Refactoring Kata in Python (effort time: 4h)

Some possible upgrades to this code with more available effort time:
  - Containerize it with dockers.
  - Add more robustness checking possible errors like an Item with Null values.
  - Add comments to explain functions.
  
Another way to implement a solution for this code is with event handlers in item_types.
